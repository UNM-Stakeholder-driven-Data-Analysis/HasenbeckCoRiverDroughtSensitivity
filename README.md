#### Purpose ####
This project considers the impact of drought on transbasin diversions in Colorado, using a drought index (SWSI),diversion data and reservoir outflows to understand correlation between drought and diversions and deliveries of transbasin-diverted water.
Four transbasin diversions are considered: the San Juan Chama Project, Denver Water, Colorado Big Thompson Project and the Frying Pan Arkansas Project. 

Scripts are named 1, 2, or 3, refering to the order they should be ran in. This project is intended to be ran project by project after running the SWSI script. After running the SWSI script, you can completley run any project by working through scripts in the project file. 

First, run the SWSI data cleaning script. Enter project files to see scripts for four transbasin projects.
Second, run data cleaning scripts in project file. 
Finally, run the model script in the project file to generate results. Repeat for other transbasin diversion projects.
