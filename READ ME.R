# This project considers the impact of drought on transbasin diversions in Colorado, using a drought index (SWSI), 
# diversion data and reservoir outflows to understand correlation between drought and diversions and deliveries of transbasin-diverted water.
# 
# Four transbasin diversions are considered: the San Juan Chama Project, Denver Water, Colorado Big Thompson Project and the Frying Pan Arkansas Project. 
# 
# Scripts are numbered in order they should be ran. 
# First, run the SWSI data cleaning script. 
# Then enter project files to see scripts for specific transbasin projects. 
# Second, run data cleaning scripts in project files. 
# Finally, run the model script in the project file to generate results.
